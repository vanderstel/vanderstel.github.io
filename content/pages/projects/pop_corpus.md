Summary: A corpus that includes one popular melody from each year of the 20th century (1900–1999).

In 2019-2020, in collaboration with my dissertation advisor Davy Temperley, I wrote a corpus that includes one popular melody from each year of the 20th century (1900–1999).

For the time being the corpus is hosted at [https://github.com/vanderstel/pop-corpus](https://github.com/vanderstel/pop-corpus).
