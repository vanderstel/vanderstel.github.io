Summary: How I built it.

I wanted this site to be as simple as possible. This reflects in the site's minimal design, as well as the tech stack I chose to get the job done.

I love Python, so I chose [*Pelican*](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/) as my static site generator. 

The site is hosted for free on [*GitHub Pages*](https://pages.github.com/). Updates to the site are immediately live when I push my code to [the site repo](https://github.com/vanderstel/vanderstel.github.io).

The form back end is set up with [*Formspree*](https://formspree.io/).

I used [*Bootstrap 4*](https://getbootstrap.com/) as my front end framework.
