Summary: An online learning platform for music theory that provides realtime feedback on interactive part-writing exercises.

I am currently developing a software-as-service application for music theory learning, titled *Euphony*. The platform includes a browser-based music notation editor designed for SATB part writing, that provides realtime feedback on errors such as parallel 5ths.

With the goal in mind of commercializing this software for use in music schools, I have been very fortunate to receive desk space at the [NextCorps startup incubator](https://nextcorps.org/) in downtown Rochester.
