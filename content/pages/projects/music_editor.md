Summary: An online learning platform for music theory that provides realtime feedback on interactive part-writing exercises.

I am currently developing a browser-based music notation editor titled *Euphony*, which is designed for SATB part writing. Users receive realtime feedback on voice-leading errors such as parallel 5ths.
