I am a musician, web developer, and educator based in Rochester, New York.

As a musician, I am currently writing a [dissertation on syncopation in 20th-century American popular music](/projects/dissertation), with my advisor [David Temperley](http://davidtemperley.com/) at the [Eastman School of Music](https://www.esm.rochester.edu/).

As a web developer, I build educational tools for musicians and music educators. Chief among these tools is an [online learning platform](/projects/euphony) for music theory, which I am developing at the [NextCorps startup incubator](https://nextcorps.org/) in downtown Rochester. Among other apps, I developed the software for [MusEdConnect](https://www.musedconnect.com/), a company that connects music education students with public school music teachers. I occasionally accept freelance work when I have the time.

As an educator, I work with students in Eastman's music theory curriculum. I also offer a course on web design and usability at Eastman's [Institute for Music Leadership](https://iml.esm.rochester.edu/), and a 2-week intensive "Web Designer Bootcamp" in the University of Rochester's [Pre-College curriculum](https://enrollment.rochester.edu/precollege/non-credit-courses/).
