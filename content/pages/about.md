I am a music theorist, web developer, and educator based in Rochester, New York.

As a music theorist, I am currently writing a [dissertation on syncopation in 20th-century American popular music](/projects/dissertation), with my advisor [David Temperley](http://davidtemperley.com/) at the [Eastman School of Music](https://www.esm.rochester.edu/). I have published in [Psychology of Music](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0305735619832959) (2019), and presented at the Society for Music Perception and Cognition (2013, 2015, 2017) as well as the International Society for Music Information Retrieval (2018).

As a web developer, I am primarily interested in music notation software that aids music learning. I am developing a [notation editor](/projects/euphony) that provides users with real-time feedback on part writing and counterpoint exercises. Among other apps, I developed the software for [MusEdConnect](https://www.musedconnect.com/), a company that connects music education students with public school music teachers.

As an educator, I work with students in Eastman's music theory curriculum. I also offer a course on web design and usability at Eastman's [Institute for Music Leadership](https://iml.esm.rochester.edu/) (2017-), and a 2-week intensive "Web Designer Bootcamp" in the University of Rochester's [Pre-College curriculum](https://enrollment.rochester.edu/precollege/non-credit-courses/) (2018-). In 2018 and 2019 I was invited to serve as a faculty member of the [Eastman Leadership Academy](https://iml.esm.rochester.edu/leadership-conference/academy/about-the-eastman-leadership-academy/), which attracts top music students from around the country.
