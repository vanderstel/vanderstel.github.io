I am a web developer, music theorist, and educator based in Rochester, New York.

As a web developer, I build applications in the browser that facilitate music learning. I recently joined [Artusi](https://www.artusi.xyz/), a small tech startup with the mission of helping people learn and teach music theory. As Vice President of Technology at Artusi, I play a key role in the development of a web application that is used in music theory courses across the country.

As a music theorist, I am currently writing a [dissertation on syncopation in 20th-century American popular music](/projects/dissertation), with my advisor [David Temperley](http://davidtemperley.com/) at the [Eastman School of Music](https://www.esm.rochester.edu/). I have published in [Psychology of Music](http://bit.do/ap_music) (2019), and presented at the Society for Music Perception and Cognition (2013, 2015, 2017) as well as the International Society for Music Information Retrieval (2018).

As an educator, I work with students in Eastman's music theory curriculum. I also offer a course on web design and usability at Eastman's [Institute for Music Leadership](https://iml.esm.rochester.edu/) (2017-), and a 2-week intensive "Web Designer Bootcamp" in the University of Rochester's [Pre-College curriculum](https://enrollment.rochester.edu/precollege/non-credit-courses/) (2018-). In 2018, 2019, and 2020 I was invited to serve as a faculty member of the [Eastman Leadership Academy](https://iml.esm.rochester.edu/leadership-academy/).
