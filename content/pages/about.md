I am a web developer and music theorist based in Rochester, New York.

As a web developer, I build applications in the browser that facilitate music learning. I am Vice President of Technology at [Artusi](https://www.artusimusic.com/), a small tech startup with the mission of helping people learn and teach music theory. At Artusi, I play a key role in the development of a web application that is used in music theory courses around the world.

As a music theorist, I have published in [Psychology of Music](http://bit.do/ap_music) (2019), and presented at the Society for Music Perception and Cognition (2013, 2015, 2017), the International Society for Music Information Retrieval (2018), and the Society for Music Theory (2021, forthcoming).
