I am a web developer and music theorist based in Rochester, New York.

As a web developer, I build applications in the browser that facilitate music learning. I am Vice President of Technology at [Artusi](https://www.artusimusic.com/), an edtech company with the mission of helping people teach and learn music theory. At Artusi, I play a key role in the development of a web application that is used in music theory courses around the world.

As a music theorist, I am interested in syncopation, particularly how it has changed over time in American popular music. My dissertation on this topic received the 2023 Alfred Mann Dissertation Award.
