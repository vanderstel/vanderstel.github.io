I am a web developer, music theorist, and educator, and I combine these roles to build interactive tools that help people teach and learn music theory.

I am Vice President of Technology at [Artusi](https://www.artusimusic.com/), an edtech company that publishes interactive workbooks on music theory and aural skills.

As a music theorist I am interested in syncopation, particularly how it has changed over time in American popular music. My dissertation on this topic received the 2023 Alfred Mann Dissertation Award.

Previously I taught music theory and entrepreneurship at Eastman School of Music and music technology at MIT.
